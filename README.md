Sample Snake game written using ionic framework and Angular.

##### Application development / testing

If you're testing the app in your web browser you can change the snake movement using the arrow keys.

If you're testing the app on the mobile device tap the left part of the screen (if you want the snake to turn left) or the right part of the screen (if you want to turn the snake right).
